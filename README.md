Walternate is a small project that will help you discover new Movies and TV Shows.

Compared to other recommendation services, Walternate don't use social commonalities.
The system is actually very simple and is entirely based on the fact you may love the work of the crew.

For example, if you like the movie Serenity which follow the TV show Firefly by Joss Whedon, there is a great probability that you also love the other TV shows of Joss Whedon. 
You may like Nathan Fillon in Castle or even the role of Morena Baccarin in Homeland.

Walternate let you navigate through the crew members, from movie to movies and will rely on serendipity.

As it's mostly a side project of mine, it will probably stay very simple.
